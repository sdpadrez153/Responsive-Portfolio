      <p>Hi and Welcome! I am Daniel and this is my first webpage.  Yes, I know it looks pretty plain Jane right now but watch out world! Because in 3-Months I am going to be a Full-Stack Developer!</p>

      <p>A bit about me, I am currently work in the wonderful world of Retail as a Co-Manager for Sam’s Club.  Have been with the company for about 12 years now and have enjoyed my time in management thus far.  Like all jobs it has its ups and downs its good days and bad days but the good outweigh the bad.  The best thing that I love about my job is the people I work with, being able to interact and have an impact on their day to day makes it all worth it.</p>

      <p>When I am not working I enjoy long walks on the beach and cuddling up to a good Nicholas Spark movie.  In all seriousness, I enjoy working out, playing video games, I’am a HUUUUGE DragonBall Nerd, Love Football (Go Chargers!) and I love to eat!</p>

      <p>Thanks for visiting My Page!</p>
